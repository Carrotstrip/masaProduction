    readers: submitted parts go here, to be read and commented on by production
    readers and then approved
    we can reuse the react componnt that we write for parts, there just won't be a principal machinist yet. We can have
    one page that is just called "part" that shows the reader format before it's approved and then archives the reader comments
    and shows the relevant info for the part
